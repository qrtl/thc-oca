This module simplifies the process of modifying print report labels,
allowing users to make changes directly through custom report label
records, without the complexity of developing custom modules.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

-  Go to Settings and select Custom Report Label to create new records.
-  For model_id, choose the model whose print report labels you want to
   change.
-  template_id is optional. Setting it applies changes only to the
   specified template's labels. Without setting it, changes affect all
   reports of the related model if the existing label exists in those
   templates.
-  In existing_label, enter the label you want to replace, including
   symbols like '>' and '<' (e.g., >Description<).
-  For custom_label, input your new label, also including symbols if
   necessary (e.g., >New Description<).
